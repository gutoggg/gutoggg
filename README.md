**I am Brazilian, graduated in Mathematics at the Federal University of Pelotas, born in Ubatuba/SP, but I currently live in ViamÃ£o/RS.<br><br>**

I've startered to study coding by myself when i realize that was possible to create my own maps on warcraft III. From that day until now, i've been studing coding by my self, stoping sometimes, but never forgetting the affection that i had for programming.<br>
With the beggining of the pandemic, in 2020, i save some time of my schedule cause everything that i needed to do was remote. So i was start to study again, now with more energy and with focus.<br>
Right now, in 2022, im participating of a programm called Desenvolve, that give me the chance, for the very first time, to study with guidance and improve myself to finnaly migrate to the programmer career.
