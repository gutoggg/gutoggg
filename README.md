**I am Brazilian, graduated in Mathematics at the Federal University of Pelotas, born in Ubatuba/SP, but I currently live in ViamÃ£o/RS.<br><br>**

I've startered to study coding by myself when i realized that was possible to create my own maps on warcraft III. From that day until now, i've been studing coding, stoping sometimes, but never forgetting the affection that i had for programming.<br>
With the beggining of the pandemic, in 2020, i saved some time of my schedule cause everything that i needed to do was remote. So i just started to study again, now with more energy and focus. Now, i can say that coding is part of my life.

* Fun fact: I can drink a lot of water in a short time. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
